1. What are the recommended settings for PHP error handling in a secure php.ini configuration?

Answer:
The cheat sheet suggests several error handling settings to enforce secure error reporting. Key recommendations include:
• Setting expose_php to Off so that PHP does not disclose its presence or version.
• Configuring error_reporting to E_ALL to log every error without suppressing any.
• Turning display_errors and display_startup_errors Off to avoid exposing error details to end users.
• Enabling log_errors On and specifying a valid log file path using error_log (e.g., /valid_path/PHP-logs/php_error.log) so that errors are recorded securely.
• Setting ignore_repeated_errors to Off, ensuring that every error occurrence is logged. 
Together, these settings help prevent exposing sensitive information in a production environment while still keeping a detailed log for legitimate debugging and auditing purposes.

2. Why is it important to set display_errors to Off on a production server?

Answer:
Displaying errors on a production server can inadvertently leak sensitive information like file paths, SQL queries, or configuration settings. Such details can be exploited by attackers to craft targeted attacks (for instance, through SQL injection, path traversal, or revealing internal implementation details). By setting display_errors to Off, the configuration ensures that error details are confined to secure log files (where they are reviewed by administrators) rather than being exposed to users. This practice helps maintain a secure, professional environment and minimizes the risk of information disclosure.

3. How do allow_url_fopen Off and allow_url_include Off contribute to preventing security vulnerabilities such as LFI and RFI?

Answer:
The configuration directives allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include control whether PHP can use URL-aware fopen wrappers or include files over a URL. When these settings are Off:
• allow_url_fopen = Off prevents PHP’s file handling functions from accessing remote resources, which helps prevent local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities from escalating to remote file inclusion (RFI) attacks.
• allow_url_include = Off stops PHP’s include and require statements from including remote files.
By disabling these features, the configuration reduces the attacker’s ability to manipulate file handling routines to include malicious remote code, ensuring that only trusted local files are executed.

4. What considerations should be made in configuring PHP file uploads, especially if the application does not require file uploads?

Answer:
The cheat sheet provides explicit file upload settings:
• file_uploads is set to On to allow file uploads.
• upload_tmp_dir specifies a secure directory for temporarily storing uploaded files.
• upload_max_filesize limits the size of each individual file (e.g., 2M) and max_file_uploads limits the number of files per request.
When file uploads are necessary, these values ensure that uploads are managed securely and resources are properly constrained. However, if the application does not require any file upload functionality, it is advisable to turn file_uploads Off altogether, thereby eliminating a potential attack vector (such as uploading a malicious file) and simplifying the security model.

5. What PHP functions are recommended to be disabled in the configuration, and why is disabling these functions important?

Answer:
In the PHP executable handling section, a list of dangerous functions is disabled using disable_functions. Some of these include:
• system, exec, shell_exec, passthru – used for system-level command execution.
• phpinfo – reveals detailed PHP configuration and environment details.
• show_source, highlight_file – can expose source code.
• popen, proc_open – open process resources.
• Several file system and environment manipulation functions like fopen_with_path, putenv, move_uploaded_file, chdir, mkdir, chmod, rename, etc.
Disabling these functions is important because each can be exploited if an attacker gains control of the application or input. By disabling unnecessary and potentially dangerous functions, the risk of executing malicious system commands or revealing sensitive internal system information is significantly reduced.

6. What session handling configurations are considered most critical for securing PHP sessions?

Answer:
Session handling is described as one of the most critical security aspects in the cheat sheet. Key session settings recommended include:
• Changing session.name from the default (typically PHPSESSID) to a custom value (e.g., myPHPSESSID) which helps obscure session handling details.
• Setting session.save_path to a secure directory (e.g., /path/PHP-session/) to control where session data is stored.
• Disabling session.auto_start and session.use_trans_sid to ensure sessions are started explicitly and to avoid URL-based session identifiers.
• Enforcing session.use_strict_mode, session.use_cookies, and session.use_only_cookies which ensures that sessions are only managed via cookies, eliminating vulnerabilities related to session fixation or hijacking.
• Fine-tuning cookie parameters including session.cookie_secure, session.cookie_httponly, and session.cookie_samesite to enforce that cookies are transmitted over secure channels, not accessible via client-side scripts, and only sent in a same-site context.
These settings collectively help in protecting against common session-related attacks and ensure that session data is handled securely.

7. Explain the roles of session.use_strict_mode and session.use_only_cookies in PHP session management.

Answer:
• session.use_strict_mode: When enabled (set to 1), this ensures that PHP will not accept uninitialized session IDs. This means that if an attacker attempts to set or use invalid session IDs, PHP will generate a new session, helping to prevent session fixation attacks. Strict mode helps maintain the integrity of session identifiers.
• session.use_only_cookies: When enabled (set to 1), it forces the session module to only use cookies for storing session IDs, and not allow passing session identifiers via URLs or other less secure means. This prevents exposure of session IDs in URL parameters (which could be leaked via HTTP referrers or logs) and offers a more secure mechanism for session tracking.
Together, these settings ensure that session IDs are both securely generated and transmitted exclusively via secure cookie mechanisms.

8. What is Snuffleupagus, and why might it be appropriate for securing PHP environments?

Answer:
Snuffleupagus is a security module for PHP that acts as a modern descendant of the Suhosin patch. It’s designed to provide advanced security features for PHP 7 and later versions. Key points include:
• It offers protection against many common vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall security of PHP applications.
• Snuffleupagus contains features such as exploit-specific mitigations, refined input validation, and various advanced security checks.
• It is considered stable and production-ready, meaning it can be confidently deployed in live environments.
Using Snuffleupagus, developers can add another robust layer of defense to PHP applications, especially in scenarios where standard PHP configurations require reinforcement against sophisticated attacks.

9. What system-specific customizations are necessary when implementing this secure php.ini configuration?

Answer:
The cheat sheet indicates that several settings need to be adapted based on your specific system environment. Examples include:
• session.save_path: The directory where PHP session data is saved (e.g., /path/PHP-session/). Ensure this path exists and has proper permissions.
• session.cookie_path: Should be set to the correct base path of your web application (e.g., /var/www/mysite or /application/path/).
• session.cookie_domain: Must be tailored to your domain (e.g., full.qualified.domain.name or ExampleSite.com) to ensure cookies are properly bound.
• Directory settings for doc_root, open_basedir, include_path, extension_dir, mime_magic.magicfile, and upload_tmp_dir should all be set to paths corresponding to your server’s file system.
Adapting these settings ensures that PHP operates within the designated directories and adheres to your overall server security policy, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or execution of PHP scripts outside the intended environment.

10. Why is it advisable to change the default session.name in PHP, and how does doing so improve security?

Answer:
Changing the default session.name (typically PHPSESSID) to a custom value (e.g., myPHPSESSID) is a recommended security practice because:
• It helps obscure standard identifiers that attackers may target during automated probing or exploitation attempts. The default session name is widely known, and changing it makes it less predictable.
• A custom session name can reduce the risk of session fixation attacks where attackers might rely on standardized names to manipulate sessions.
• It aligns with the principle of "security through obscurity" as an added, though not sole, measure to deter casual attempts to hijack session data.
By altering session.name, developers introduce an additional, simple barrier against generic exploitation tactics aimed at default PHP behaviors.
