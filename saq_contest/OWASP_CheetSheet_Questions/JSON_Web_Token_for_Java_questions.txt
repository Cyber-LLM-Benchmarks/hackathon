1. What is a JSON Web Token (JWT) and why is it valuable for stateless authentication?

Answer:
A JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact, self-contained means to securely transmit information between parties in the form of a JSON object. It is valuable for stateless authentication because:
• It carries authentication and authorization details (claims) that can be verified by the server without maintaining session state.
• The token is digitally signed (using HMAC with a secret key or an RSA public/private key pair), which ensures the token’s integrity and that it cannot be tampered with.
• Being self-contained, it facilitates interoperability between different technologies, meaning the client and server do not need to share the same infrastructure.
• Its portability allows authentication to work over various transport channels, even though HTTP is most common.

2. Describe the structure of a JWT and explain the role of each of its three components.

Answer:
A JWT is composed of three parts that are separated by dots ('.'). The structure is as follows:  
 [Base64(HEADER)].[Base64(PAYLOAD)].[Base64(SIGNATURE)]

• Header: Contains metadata about the token. This usually includes the type ("JWT") and the signing algorithm (e.g., "HS256" for HMAC-SHA256).
 For example:
 {
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
 }

• Payload: Contains the claims – the information we want to transmit. Claims can include the subject (sub), name, role (admin flag), expiration time, issuer, etc.
 For example:
 {
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
 }

• Signature: The signature is generated by encoding the header and payload using a secret key (or key pair) and the specified algorithm. It ensures the token hasn’t been altered. The formation is:
 HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), KEY).

3. What is the “None” hashing algorithm vulnerability in JWT libraries, and how can developers mitigate this risk?

Answer:
The “None” algorithm vulnerability occurs when a JWT library incorrectly accepts tokens that specify “none” as the hashing algorithm. In these cases, an attacker can modify the claims of a JWT and simply change the algorithm to “none” to bypass signature verification. To mitigate this risk:
• Always use a secure JWT library that does not allow tokens signed using the “none” algorithm.
• During token verification, explicitly request the expected algorithm (e.g., HMAC256) so that the verification context does not accept an unsigned or tampered token.
• In the provided example, the code snippet creates a verification context using JWT.require(Algorithm.HMAC256(keyHMAC)).build(), making sure that only tokens signed with HMAC256 are accepted.

4. Explain what token sidejacking is and how the use of a user context (or fingerprint) can help prevent it.

Answer:
Token sidejacking is an attack where an attacker intercepts (or steals) a valid token and uses it to impersonate a legitimate user. Since the token contains all authentication information and is sent with every request, the attacker can gain unauthorized access.
To prevent token sidejacking:
• Include a user context in the token that binds the token to a particular user session. For example, generating a random string (user fingerprint) during authentication.
• Store the raw fingerprint in a hardened cookie with flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) and include only a SHA256 hash of the fingerprint in the token payload. This way, even if the token is stolen, it cannot be used unless the attacker also has the valid hardened cookie.
• During token validation, the server recalculates the hash from the cookie value and compares it to the hash stored in the token. If they don’t match, the token is rejected.

5. JWT tokens have no built-in revocation mechanism. How can an application manage token revocation (for example, on user logout) securely?

Answer:
Since JWT tokens are stateless, a token is considered valid until it expires. There isn’t a native logout mechanism like traditional session-based authentication. To manage token revocation securely, developers can:
• Implement a token denylist (or revocation list) on the server side. When a user “logs out,” the token’s digest (a SHA256 hash of the token) is stored in a denylist database table along with a revocation timestamp.
• The application then checks every incoming token against this denylist before processing the request.
• The denylist can be maintained until the token naturally expires, thereby simulating a logout mechanism in a stateless environment.

6. What is token information disclosure, and what measures can be taken to hide sensitive information within a token?

Answer:
Token information disclosure occurs when an attacker gains access to a JWT and inspects the payload, revealing sensitive data such as roles, login information, or other internal details. Even though the payload is base64-encoded, it is not encrypted by default.
Measures to prevent information disclosure include:
• Ciphering (encrypting) the token to conceal its contents. By encrypting the token using a strong symmetric encryption algorithm like AES in Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM), you not only protect the confidentiality of the token’s data but also ensure its integrity via associated data.
• Even though signing validates that the token was not tampered with, encryption ensures that the internal details are hidden from prying eyes.
• Use libraries like Google Tink which implement AES-GCM with built-in best practices supporting authenticated encryption.

7. Why is the method chosen for token storage on the client side critical for security, and what are the best practices for token storage in a browser?

Answer:
The method of token storage on the client side is critical because:
• Some storage options, like localStorage, are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks; an attacker may obtain the token if they can run malicious scripts in the browser.
• Cookies can be automatically sent with every request and, if not properly hardened, may be exploited through XSS or cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
Best practices for secure token storage include:
• For stateless applications, consider storing the token in the browser’s sessionStorage (which clears on browser close), reducing the window for an XSS attack.
• Alternatively, if persistence across tabs or restarts is required, store tokens in localStorage but implement short expiration times and use token renewal strategies.
• Use secure cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite flags if token storage in cookies is necessary.
• Add a fingerprint (user context) to further bind the token to a specific session.
• Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict harmful script injection and reduce XSS risk.

8. How can using a weak secret when generating JWTs create vulnerabilities, and what steps should developers take to strengthen token secrets?

Answer:
When using HMAC-based algorithms, the security of the JWT is completely dependent on the strength of the secret key. A weak secret can be discovered via brute force or dictionary attacks using tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat. If an attacker manages to crack the secret, they can forge tokens, escalate privileges, and impersonate users.
To strengthen token secrets, developers should:
• Use secrets that are at least 64 characters long.
• Generate the secret using a strong source of randomness (cryptographically secure random numbers).
• Consider using asymmetric algorithms (e.g., RSA) where the private key remains secure on the server and the corresponding public key can be used for verification.
• Ensure that secrets are stored securely in memory and are not exposed accidentally.

9. Explain how Google Tink facilitates secure token ciphering and the benefits of using AES-GCM for this purpose.

Answer:
Google Tink is a cryptographic library that simplifies the use of best-practice encryption methods. In the context of token ciphering:
• It provides a high-level API for encryption and decryption operations that abstracts away many of the pitfalls associated with cryptographic implementations.
• When used for token ciphering, Tink’s AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) primitive, such as AES-GCM, ensures that the token is both confidential (encrypted) and its authenticity is verified (protected against tampering).
• AES-GCM offers the benefits of:
 – Authenticated encryption: It verifies that the data has not been altered and confirms its origin.
 – Resistance to common cryptanalysis attacks, including padding oracle attacks.
• In the implementation example, the TokenCipher class uses Tink to register AEAD, then encrypts a JWT (and later decrypts it), ensuring that the token’s payload remains confidential, even if intercepted.

10. Given that JWTs lack a native logout or token revocation mechanism, how can an application simulate “logout” functionality using a token denylist?

Answer:
JWTs are self-contained and are valid until their expiration, meaning that on logout, the server cannot simply “destroy” a server-side session. To simulate logout functionality:
• Implement a token denylist where, upon logout, the token (or, more securely, a digest – such as a SHA256 hash of the token) is stored in a centralized revocation storage (e.g., a database table).
• When processing a request, the server must check the incoming token’s digest against the denylist. If it is present, the token is considered revoked and the request is rejected.
• This method mimics a session termination by invalidating the token immediately, even if its expiration time has not been reached.
• The approach is especially useful in distributed systems where multiple instances need to verify token revocation status.
