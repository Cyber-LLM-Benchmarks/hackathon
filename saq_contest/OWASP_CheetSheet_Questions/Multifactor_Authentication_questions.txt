1. Question: What is Multifactor Authentication (MFA) and what are the five different types of authentication factors included in the cheat sheet?

Answer: Multifactor Authentication (MFA), sometimes called Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), is a security method in which a user must present more than one type of evidence (or factor) to prove their identity when accessing a system. The cheat sheet defines five different types of factors: 
• Something You Know – e.g., passwords, PINs, and security questions.
• Something You Have – e.g., OTP tokens (hardware or software), U2F tokens, certificates, smart cards, email, SMS, and phone calls.
• Something You Are – e.g., biometric methods such as fingerprints, facial recognition, and iris scans.
• Somewhere You Are – e.g., authentication factors based on source IP address, geolocation, or geofencing.
• Something You Do – e.g., behavioral profiling, keystroke and mouse dynamics, and gait analysis.
Each of these factors should be independent to ensure that compromising one does not inherently compromise the others, which is why using two instances of the same type (like a password and a PIN) does not meet the criteria for true MFA.

2. Question: What are the primary advantages and disadvantages of implementing MFA in an application?

Answer: MFA introduces several significant advantages as well as some disadvantages:
Advantages:
• Improves security by defending against common password-related attacks (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing, and password spraying) since attackers would need multiple independent factors to compromise an account.
• Helps mitigate the risks associated with weak, reused, or stolen passwords, a major vulnerability in many authentication systems.
• Enhances protection for high-value targets such as administrative accounts.
Disadvantages:
• Increases management complexity for both administrators and end users, potentially leading to poor user experiences.
• May require additional hardware, which brings increased cost and logistical challenges (e.g., hardware tokens, smart cards).
• Introduces extra steps that can lead to user lockouts if the secondary factor is lost or unavailable.
• Adds complexity to the overall application, which may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities or single points of failure, particularly if external MFA providers are used.
• Requires robust recovery and reset procedures to avoid potential attack vectors from MFA bypass mechanisms.

3. Question: How does Risk Based Authentication improve the user experience when implementing MFA, and what are some scenarios where it can be applied?

Answer: Risk Based Authentication (RBA) enhances user experience by adapting when MFA is required based on the perceived risk of the authentication attempt rather than mandating MFA each time. The idea is to reduce the burden on the user while maintaining higher security for potentially risky activities. Examples include:
• Prompting for MFA only when the login attempt occurs from a new device or a new geographic location.
• Applying additional authentication requirements when users log in from networks that fall outside a pre-defined “trusted” range, such as an unfamiliar public Wi-Fi network.
• Skipping extra factors when the user's behavior aligns with their typical usage patterns (e.g., time of access, typical browser, or IP address).
This dynamic approach helps reduce user friction while still safeguarding against unusual or high-risk activities, balancing security with usability.

4. Question: What steps should be taken when a user fails to authenticate with MFA after entering their password?

Answer: A failed MFA attempt may indicate either that the user has lost access to the second factor or that the user’s password might have been compromised. To address this, the following steps should be implemented:
• Prompt the user to select or try another available MFA method (if multiple options have been set up).
• Provide a secure procedure that allows for an MFA reset; this may involve sending recovery codes, verifying through additional communication channels, or using an alternate trusted factor.
• Notify the user about the failed authentication attempt, including details such as time, browser information, and geographic location, so that they can take steps (like changing their password) if suspicious activity is suspected.
These measures help ensure that a lost MFA token does not result in permanent lockout and at the same time alert the user to potential security breaches.

5. Question: Why are security questions considered deprecated for authentication purposes according to the cheat sheet?

Answer: Security questions are no longer recognized as an acceptable authentication factor by standards such as NIST SP 800-63. There are several reasons for this:
• Predictability – Answers to many common security questions (e.g., “What is your mother’s maiden name?”) are often easily guessable or discoverable via social media.
• Inconsistency – Users might not remember their answers years later, rendering them unreliable for secure account recovery.
• Lack of additional security benefit – They do not provide a significant level of security beyond what is offered by passwords.
Given these shortcomings, security questions should not be relied upon as a primary or strong secondary factor and are recommended only for account recovery under stringent validation processes.

6. Question: What are the differences between hardware OTP tokens and software OTP tokens in terms of functionality, security, and usability?

Answer: Both hardware and software OTP tokens generate one-time passwords typically using the Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) algorithm, but they differ in several respects:
Hardware OTP Tokens:
• Functionality: Standalone physical devices (such as RSA SecurID) that generate a numeric code displayed on the device.
• Security: They are secure because they exist independently from the user’s computer or mobile phone, making remote compromise highly unlikely.
• Usability: They add administrative overhead owing to physical distribution, potential costs, and the inconvenience if a device is lost.
Software OTP Tokens:
• Functionality: Utilized via mobile applications (like Google Authenticator) where the user scans a QR code, and the app generates a six-digit code each 60 seconds.
• Security: They are generally secure and cost-effective though potentially vulnerable if installed on compromised devices or if backup seeds are stored insecurely.
• Usability: They offer ease of use and do not require shipping physical tokens, but depend on the user owning a compatible mobile device. Each method has its trade-offs based on cost, risk tolerance, and feasibility for the targeted user base.

7. Question: What is Universal Second Factor (U2F) authentication, and what are its main benefits and potential drawbacks?

Answer: Universal Second Factor (U2F) is a standard for second-factor authentication that utilizes hardware tokens (often USB or NFC-based devices like the YubiKey) to perform challenge–response authentication. The key benefits include:
• Resistance to phishing attacks, as the private key remains on the token and is never transferred, ensuring that even if a user submits credentials to a phishing site, the token will not authenticate.
• User convenience, since authentication requires only a physical action like pressing a button on the token rather than entering a code manually.
• Enhanced security through physical separation, making remote compromise considerably more difficult.
Drawbacks include:
• Additional costs and logistical challenges because the tokens need to be purchased and distributed.
• Potential for token loss, which could lock out the user if recovery processes are not robust.
• Dependency on physical connectivity (USB or NFC) which might sometimes lead to usability issues if the token is forgotten.
Thus, while U2F is highly secure, its deployment must take into account cost, distribution challenges, and user education.

8. Question: What are the pros and cons of using SMS messages and phone calls for MFA purposes?

Answer: SMS messages and phone calls are among the simplest methods to deliver one-time codes for MFA; however, they come with significant benefits and drawbacks:
Pros:
• Simple Implementation: They are easy to set up within an existing authentication framework with minimal extra hardware needed.
• Wide Reach: Many users have access to mobile phones, which makes this approach broadly applicable.
Cons:
• Signal Dependency: The user must have mobile coverage or a landline, and interruptions in service can prevent timely delivery.
• Cost Concerns: The service provider may incur costs for sending messages or making calls, particularly if an attacker makes repeated requests.
• Vulnerabilities: SMS is prone to phishing attacks and SIM swapping, where an attacker transfers the victim’s number to gain access.
• Security Dependence: If the user’s email or phone is compromised (often having weak or reused passwords), then the MFA security from SMS might be undermined.
These factors suggest that while SMS-based MFA can be convenient, it may not be appropriate for high-value accounts or applications that handle highly sensitive information.

9. Question: What are passkeys, and how do they integrate aspects of both possession-based and other authentication factors to provide secure MFA?

Answer: Passkeys are an emerging form of login credentials based on the FIDO2 standard. They represent a fusion of factors: they are possession-based in that a physical device (such as the user’s smartphone) is required, while they also incorporate either knowledge-based (like a PIN) or inherence-based (biometric) verification. When using a passkey, the user first authenticates locally using a PIN or biometric method. Then, the device generates a unique cryptographic key that is used to securely authenticate with the server. Key features include:
• Enhanced Security: Since the private key never leaves the device and is generated per site, passkeys are resistant to phishing.
• Improved Usability: They narrow the gap between robust security and ease of use, requiring less friction compared to traditional OTP-based MFA.
• Seamless Integration: The technology integrates into modern authentication frameworks and can eventually replace traditional passwords.
Thus, passkeys provide a modern, secure, and user-friendly approach to MFA by combining the best attributes of multiple authentication factors.

10. Question: How do biometric authentication methods function as a factor in MFA, and what are their advantages and potential concerns?

Answer: Biometric authentication relies on verifying unique physical traits or behavior of the user, such as fingerprint scans, facial recognition, iris scans, or even voice recognition. In the context of MFA, biometrics serve as the “something you are” factor. Advantages include:
• High Security for Targeted Attacks: Well-implemented biometric systems are difficult to spoof, meaning that successful impersonation typically requires a targeted breach.
• User Convenience: Biometric methods are fast and convenient, often automating the authentication process with minimal user intervention.
However, there are notable concerns:
• Enrollment and Hardware Requirements: Users need to enroll in a biometric system, and the process may require specialized, sometimes expensive, hardware.
• Privacy Risks: Biometric data is sensitive; if this data is compromised, it cannot be “changed” like a password.
• Risk of False Positives/Negatives: Biometric systems may suffer from inaccuracies, especially under conditions of poor quality data capture.
• Implementation Complexity: Integrating biometrics securely into a system adds technical complexity and risks that must be carefully managed.
Overall, while biometric factors provide an additional layer of security and convenience, they must be weighed against privacy implications and implementation challenges.
